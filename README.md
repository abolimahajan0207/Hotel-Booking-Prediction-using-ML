# Hotel-Booking-Prediction-using-ML
Overview:
The project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to gain insights into the booking patterns of hotel rooms. By leveraging Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, sorting, and data preparation, this endeavor sets out to enhance understanding and decision-making within the hospitality industry.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical hotel booking data and develop predictive models that can forecast future booking trends. By employing machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to identify patterns, preferences, and factors influencing booking behaviors.

Methodology:
Data Collection: Gathered historical hotel booking data encompassing various attributes such as booking dates, hotel type, customer demographics, and reservation durations.
Data Cleaning: Employed Python libraries like pandas to clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing inconsistencies.
Preprocessing: Utilized techniques such as normalization and encoding to prepare the data for analysis and model training.
Sorting: Organized the dataset based on relevant parameters, facilitating efficient data exploration and modeling.
Data Preparation: Engineered features and transformed the dataset into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. This step involved splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.
Model Development: Employed various machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, or clustering to build predictive models. Experimented with different models to identify the most accurate and interpretable solution.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the nature of the problem. Employed techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization of the models.

Expected Outcome:
Through the completion of this project, it is anticipated to gain valuable insights into hotel room booking behaviors. These insights can inform strategic decisions regarding pricing strategies, resource allocation, and customer segmentation, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and profitability of hotel operations.
